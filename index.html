                        In 2007 I had the opportunity to go white water rafting on the Nile in Jinja, Uganda, "The Source of the Nile." 
                        <br> <br>
                        Aside from the fear of crocodiles, it was a great experience. I'll tell you a bit about it here.

                        Jinja is a city and metropolitan area in Uganda, located on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. Marketers often refer to it as "the adventure capital of Africa."

                        <li> Now, I don't really expect anyone to read this. But in the off-chance someone does, I'm giving a shoutout to our river guide: Juma. Dude was hilarious. <br><br>His job, as he said--perhaps simply to scare us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mzungu">wazungu</a>--was to get us on top of his kayak before the crocodiles got there if we fell out on one of the rapids. </li>
                        <li> <img src="./pictures/juma-jpeg.jpg" alt="This is Juma"> <p style = "text-align: center;">Juma</p></li>
                        <li>Part of the process of Juma explaining his job involved him unceremoniously flipping his partner kayaker over in the water while saying "now, see, if I come to you, don't do this." He flipped his partner back over. They were gasping and began yelling at Juma, who proceeded to re-flip them. "You must remain calm. Please do not yell, or panic. Because, I do not want this to happen to me. Okay?" <br><br>
                           After a few hours on the river, we took a break to just float. We passed a large rock jutting up from the water to a height of around 10ft. A few of us had decided to swim a bit, just around our rafts. 
                           <br><br>That's when he told us "You see that rock? 2 weeks ago a crocodile pulled a fisherman from his boat (small canoe-like structures) and flung him onto that rock. He died." Juma was obviously a master jokester <a href="https://www.raftafrica.com/pages/meet-the-team/">as well as being a master and famous kayaker</a>, but we all decided to get out of the water.
                           <br><br>
                           We didn't have a camera with us, but I found a gif of someone else who flipped around the same spot we did. Also, we never saw a crocodile (I have zero complaints about that).
